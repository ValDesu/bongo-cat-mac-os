## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Install Python and required dependencies:

```bash
brew install python
pip3 install PyQt6 pyobjc-framework-ApplicationServices
```

### Running the Application
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Setup

**Accessibility Permissions Required**: Make sure the terminal you're running the script from has accessibility access in macOS settings:

1. Go to **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility**
2. Add your terminal application (Terminal.app, iTerm2, VS Code, etc.)
3. Enable the checkbox for your terminal

Without this permission, the keystroke detection won't work!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Window Settings
You can customize the appearance by changing the constants at the beginning of `main.py`:

```python
ALWAYS_ON_TOP = False      # Set to True to keep window always visible
REMOVE_DECORATIONS = True  # Set to True for transparent background (enables drag-to-move)
SCALE = 1                  # Scale factor for images (1 = original size, 0.5 = half size, 2 = double size)
```

- **Always on Top**: When enabled, the Bongo Cat window stays above all other windows
- **Remove Decorations**: Creates a frameless, transparent window. When enabled, you can click and drag the cat around your screen since there's no title bar to grab
- **Scaling**: Adjust the size of the Bongo Cat. Perfect for fitting it in a corner or making it more prominent on your screen

### Custom Themes
Create your own Bongo Cat themes by making custom `.gif` images! 

**Switching Themes**: Change the `THEME` constant in `main.py` to use different themes:
```python
THEME = "default"    # Use the default theme
THEME = "nyao"       # Use the nyao theme
THEME = "your_theme" # Use your custom theme
```

**Creating New Themes**: The naming convention for theme files is:
- `00.gif` - Default state          ( no keys pressed )
- `01.gif` - Right hand active      ( inner keys )
- `02.gif` - Right hand active      ( outer keys )
- `10.gif` - Left hand active       ( outer keys )
- `11.gif` - Both hands active      ( innet + outer keys )
- `12.gif` - Both hands active      ( outer keys )
- `20.gif` - Left hand active       ( inner keys )  
- `21.gif` - Both hands active      ( inner keys )
- `22.gif` - Both hands active      ( outer + inner keys )

Place your custom `.gif` files in a new folder under `img/your_theme_name/`. The application already includes two themes: `default` and `nyao`. If you create awesome themes, don't hesitate to share them with the community!

### Streaming with OBS
![OBS Example](examples/obs.png)

Perfect for streamers! The application works great as an overlay in OBS Studio. Set `REMOVE_DECORATIONS = True` and `ALWAYS_ON_TOP = True` for the best streaming experience. You can also adjust the `SCALE` to make the cat smaller or larger to fit your streaming layout perfectly.
